# hello-world
This is my first Github repository. Infact I dont know what a repository is. Cheers!!!
Oh now I know what a repositor is. Its like a code sharing place. You have your master code ...<<which becomes a branch (in other words a editable file of a original file) ... to save change is called commit....
